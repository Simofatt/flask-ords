# Folium is a library used for rendering maps, with informational overlays. It is based off of the popular map rendering library "Leaflet.js"

from folium import plugins, JavascriptLink, Tooltip, Icon

# The same applies here. We have the base flask, but then we'll need to import things like render_template, and jsonify (in this case to help us work with json objects)

# The requests library is key. You can do much of the same with the urllib library. And you may be able to achieve similar results with Beautiful Soup. But requests is all we need to make this work.

# "Tiles" are the term for how a map will look when it is rendered. The default is OpenStreetMap, but here we are selecting Stamen Toner. There are many others, but refer to the documentation for more details: http://python-visualization.github.io/folium/quickstart.html#Getting-Started

# Initially we loaded these coordinates as NUMBER in our table. However, what we didn't realize was that "NUMBER" uses (5,2) as the default Precision and Scale.This led to all the coordinates being rounded to the same latitude and longitude. For instance, if we look at these to locations:
# - Honor Society Museum is at 36.14556332104072, -115.26720938719485
# - Marvel Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N. 36.12590711356752, -115.17028711534353
# Both were initially loaded with the complete coordinates as a NUMBER type. But since NUMBER will round with (5,2) these two locations (and all others in the same area) end up with latitude and longitude coordinates of 36.08' and -115.08'. We found that by including Precision and Scale attributes in the NUMBER statement, things returned to normal. We used the following attributes:
# Latitude - NUMBER(8,6)
# Longitude - NUMBER(9,6)
